# Introduction to Git

Git is a **distributed version control system** that helps developers track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple people to collaborate efficiently while ensuring the project's history and integrity are maintained.

## üîç Why Use Git?

- **Version History**: Revert to previous states of your project.
- **Collaboration**: Work seamlessly with multiple contributors.
- **Branching**: Experiment with features safely.
- **Speed**: Perform most operations locally with minimal latency.
- **Backup**: Every clone is a full backup of the repository.

## üöÄ Key Concepts

### Repository (Repo)
A folder that Git tracks. It contains the entire history of all files and directories in the project.

### Commit
A snapshot of the project's files at a specific point in time. Commits form the building blocks of Git history.

### Branch
A movable pointer to a commit. Branches help isolate work (e.g., for new features or bug fixes).

### Merge
Combines changes from different branches. Git tries to automatically reconcile differences.

### Clone
Creates a local copy of a remote repository, including the entire history.

### Pull / Push
- **Pull**: Fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository.
- **Push**: Upload your local changes to a remote repository.

## üîß Basic Git Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initialize a repository
git init

# 2. Add files to staging area
git add <filename>

# 3. Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# 4. Connect to a remote repository
git remote add origin <url>

# 5. Push changes
git push -u origin main
