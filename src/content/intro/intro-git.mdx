# Introduction to Git

Git is a **distributed version control system** that helps developers track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple people to collaborate efficiently while ensuring the project's history and integrity are maintained.

## üîç Why Use Git?

- **Version History**: Revert to previous states of your project.
- **Collaboration**: Work seamlessly with multiple contributors.
- **Branching**: Experiment with features safely.
- **Speed**: Perform most operations locally with minimal latency.
- **Backup**: Every clone is a full backup of the repository.

# üöÄ Key Concepts

## üß≥ Git Object has 4 fundamental objects as below

## blob

A file's content

## Commit

A snapshot of the project's files at a specific point in time. Commits form the building blocks of Git history.

## tag

a reference to the commit

## Tree

In Git, a tree is one of the core object types that represents a directory. It acts like a folder that can contain:

  - **SHA1** hashes pointing to the actual blob/tree objects
  - **type** type of pointer (blob or tree)
  - **filename** or directory name
  - **mode** (executable file , symbolic link...)

  ```
    $ git cat-file -p <tree-sha>
    100644 blob 3f4e8cd...    README.md
    100644 blob d1c3f1a...    main.js
    040000 tree 9b1cde1...    src

  // if you want to generate SHA1

   echo "Hello world" | git hash-object --stdin
  ```

## üß† Real-World Analogy
- If a Git commit is like a save point, then:
- A tree is the folder structure at that save point
- A blob is the actual content of each file

## TL;DR 
- A **tree** inGit is snapshot of a directory.
- It stores file names, persmissions, and references to file (blob) and subdirectory (tree) objects.
- It's essential for tracking project structure over time.
## üîß Basic Git Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initialize a repository
git init

# 2. Add files to staging area
git add <filename>

# 3. Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# 4. Connect to a remote repository
git remote add origin <url>

# 5. Push changes
git push -u origin main
```
